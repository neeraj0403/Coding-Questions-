## 1.Rain Water Trapping
 - **Problem** You are given an input array whose each element represents the height of a line towers. The width of every tower is 1. It starts raining. Water is filled between the gap of tower if possible. You need to find how much water filled between these given towers.

## 2.MAXIMUM SUM PATH IN TWO ARRAYS
 - **Problem** You are provided two sorted arrays. You need to find the maximum length of bitonic subsequence. You need to find the sum of the maximum sum  
 path to reach from beginning of any array to end of any of the two arrays. You can switch from one array to another array only at common elements.<br />

## 3.Aggressive Cows
 -**Problem**Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 <= N <= 100,000) stalls. The stalls are located along a straight line at positions x1,…,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).

His C (2 <= C <= N) cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, FJ wants to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?<br />

  -**Sample Input**:<br />
First line contains N and C, separated by a single space, representing the total number of stalls and number of cows respectively. The next line contains N  number of integers containing the indexes of stalls.<br />

  ## 4.BOSTON NUMBER 
  -**Problem** A Boston number is a composite number, the sum of whose digits is the sum of the digits of its prime factors obtained as a result of prime factorization (excluding 1 ). The first few such numbers are 4,22 ,27 ,58 ,85 ,94 and 121 . For example, 378 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 7 is a Boston number since 3 + 7 + 8 = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 7. Write a program to check whether a given integer is a Boston number.<br/>

  ## 5.CHEWBACCA AND NUMBER
  -**Problem** Luke Skywalker gave Chewbacca an integer number x. Chewbacca isn't good at numbers but he loves inverting digits in them. Inverting digit t means replacing it with digit 9 - t.   

Help Chewbacca to transform the initial number x to the minimum possible positive number by inverting some (possibly, zero) digits. The decimal representation of the final number shouldn't start with a zero.

   ## 6.Target Sum Pair
   Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Approach 1: Brute Force
The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element x and find if there is another value that equals to target-x.
